### 1.1 Full Name
Recycled Commodities Foundation Open Project
### 1.2 Short Name
ReCoF

##	2. Abstract
The Recycled Commodities Foundation (ReCoF) is an open forum for diverse stakeholders to create universally accepted definitions, specifications and standards for determining, obtaining, and verifying the authenticity, quality and provenance of authenticated recycled commodities in furtherance of promoting global circularity and the creation of environmental assets.

Examples of environmental assets include:
* Secondary and recycled metals
* Recycled plastics
* Apparel recycling
* Waste reduction  
* GHG & Scope 3 emissions reduction, carbon credits and carbon offsets

## 3. Statement of Purpose
The global growth in demand for Circularity and recycling have never been greater.  In spite of this demand, standardized and universal measurements of carbon emissions are severely lacking.  Global mandates originating with the United Nations, its participating members’ regulatory requirements being adopted worldwide, and the growing body of voluntary carbon reduction commitments sweeping the planet are the powerful force behind the need for the development of universal standards.

There are currently no universally acknowledged standards for the validation and verification of environmental (green) commodities (EC) and carbon offset credits.   

EC’s (“green” commodities) procured by enterprises to fulfill their voluntary, compliance, and Scope 3 reduction commitments are difficult to authenticate and measure, and are often acquired through unreliable, unverified, non-standard methods. As a result, EC’s are introduced to global supply chains without full transparency and benefits of proof of provenance, or standards that are universally recognized & accepted.

As multinationals, governments and other entities address their Net Zero Goals and supply chain GHG Protocol Scope 3 regulatory frameworks, uniform standards and registries are needed to enable parties worldwide to trade and  reliably comply to the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and other regulatory requirements and bodies that are springing forth worldwide in numerous markets.  The EU reporting requirements start Jan 1, 2024 impacting all those within and that choose to business to comply with this framework.  This underlies the overwhelming global trend and push for developing Enterprise Carbon Accounting (ECA) regulatory requirements at many levels of government as well as the private investment sector. 

In a broader sense, the lack of uniform standards limits the trade of ECs and undermines global efforts to meet new carbon emission guidelines and requirements.

The purpose of ReCoF is two-fold:
1. Develop universally-accepted standards paving the way to validate ECs & carbon offsets helping support a legitimate global marketplace that effectively drives worldwide carbon emissions reduction.
2. Provide the framework and formation of DLT (distributed ledger technology) enabled registries to assure the authenticity and the proof of provenance of EC. 

The ReCoF Open Project will form sector-led technical working groups that includes, but are not limited to, secondary metals, mining and minerals, apparel and footwear, technology and electronics, trade finance, and natural capital.

## 4. Business Benefits 
Participation in a project of this magnitude means making a profound impact on innumerable global beneficiaries including the environment as a whole.

Benefits of ReCoF standards accrue to all public and private sector entities, industries, countries, and organizations of any size.

For global carbon emissions management, at each level in the entire supply chain, both generators and suppliers will benefit as validated standards, definitions and measurements enable the efficient exchange and management of these assets.

Given Scope 3’s broad mandates, stakeholders are worldwide, diverse, and substantial in number. Potential stakeholders include, and are not limited to:
* Multinational corporations
* Governmental and non-governmental organizations
* Carbon generators and offsetters
* Commodity producers and material recyclers
* Financial markets, commodity traders, financial institutions
* Anyone who benefits from carbon emission reduction

Examples of benefits include:
* Proof of provenance or authentication of asset claims.
* Reliable verification and standard accounting of carbon credits.
* Efficient, automated exchanging of environmental assets.
* Real-time marketplace valuation of assets.
* Elimination of duplicated efforts and conflicting standards.

Specific benefits for global trade standards include:
* Independent assessment and audit of asset value claims.
* Government, not-for-profit and multinational enterprise adoption of a common set of standards and data.
* Improved liquidity to accelerate scale.
* Authenticate compliance to Scope 3 & other compliance measures
* Efficiency and cost savings
* Greater adoption of carbon emission reduction strategies.
* Fraud & declaration risk reduction.
* Reduced carbon emissions.  

Vertical industries served include:
* Natural Capital / Carbon Credcc
* Primary & Secondary Metals
* Apparel & Footwear
* Technology & Electronics
* Banking, Finance & Financial Markets

This list is not exhaustive.  Industries, verticals, products along with corresponding beneficiaries may be added as new participants and opportunities are identified.

## 5. Normative Scope
Given the scope, critical impact of this project, and growing demand for its products, it will launch in earnest and move at a deliberate pace.

The project scope will be developing a uniform set of standards and definitions addressing the recording and exchanging of EC’s in a manner that is accepted and adopted by a critical mass of highly involved global stakeholders.

While vast in user application value and opportunities, project scope will remain focused on the objectives and will not address developing standards governing markets and products that may be identified but are considered out of the scope of EC.

The project may also produce non-normative work products such as supporting documentation, proof-of-concept open source tooling, and other materials intended to encourage broad adoption and implementation of the project’s specifications


## 6. Relationship to Other Projects
This project represents a tremendous opportunity to help implement and execute standards and principles established by the GHG Protocols.   

As multinationals, governments and other entities address their Net Zero Carbon Goals and supply chain GHG Protocol Scope 3 regulatory frameworks, uniform standards are needed to enable parties worldwide to trade & reliably comply to the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and other regulatory requirements and bodies that are springing forth worldwide in numerous countries and global markets. 

Executionally, ReCoF standards lay the foundation to establish registries, which further aid in accounting, authentication, and transparency of reporting of GHG and offsetting environmental assets and will rely upon any existing protocols and standards that are considered relevant, appropriate, firmly established and already universally accepted.

This project and its products can have a profound impact on helping these principles and standards become an executional compliance reality.

Further, given the need to standardize and authenticate products and transactions, the project aligns with and complements other current OASIS groups.

The project will be unique because unlike what often happens, industry will take the lead to develop protocols, standards etc that meet industry needs. These outputs will be adapted to solve common industry problems rather than government policy initiated that often lead to difficult costly and time consuming implementation

ReCoF intends to heavily leverage the work product, processes and methodology of other OASIS groups. There are other OASIS groups that provide a solid foundation and momentum to build upon and a source of great learnings and information.
